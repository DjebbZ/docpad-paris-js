## The CMS problem(s)

In no specific order :

1. Complex, steep learning curve
2. Content model proprietary and not so obvious
3. Content prisoner of database
4. Not very well coded…
5. … and often written in *cough* PHP *cough*
6. Extending them is rather complex
7. Most of them are not RESTful
8. Front end possibilities are limited
9. Who said performance ?
10. Often too big for the needs
11. Mix UX and DX (hint: **it doesn't work**)
12. You become a CMS developer instead of a Web developer (not good)
13. and so on…
