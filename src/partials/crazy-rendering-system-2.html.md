## Crazy rendering system ? (2/2)

This works too :

- styles.css.styl.eco => Dynamically create CSS rules based on content or configuration<br>
ex: custom colors, css grid, dynamic id...
- app.js.eco => Dynamically generate js code<br>
ex: call custom code based on html id's (I did it !)
- .htaccess.eco => Dynamically create redirect rules based on content or configuration<br>
Yes we can

_Possibilities are endless_
