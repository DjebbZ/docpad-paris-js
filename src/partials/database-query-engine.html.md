## A database ? A query engine ?
## Yes, Backbone and QueryEngine !

In DocPad, content is represented as Backbone Models and Collections during the render process.

> Query-Engine provides extensive Querying, Filtering, and Searching abilities for Backbone.js Collections as well as JavaScript arrays and objects

QueryEngine supports [NoSQL queries](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Advanced+Queries). Cool.
