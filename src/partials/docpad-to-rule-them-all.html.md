## DocPad to rule them all

1. The templating/server-side language of your choice (plain HTML and CSS is fine, but also jade, eco, coffeekup, coffeescript, markdown, LESS, SASS, Stylus, Roy, even ERB or PHP !)
2. "Real" database of content with a powerful query engine
3. Crazy rendering system
4. Infinite custom metadata and configuration
5. Plugins system
6. Not limited to blogs at all : corporate, news, portfolio, presentation, whatever
